### Luke Bower

Luke Bower is a sophomore computer science student from the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is also getting a math minor. He fell in love with Computer Science in middle school after finding out how unsecure the cyber world is. He has always wanted to try and make society better and he felt like computer science was the method to achieve it. Having the previous knowledge of UAVs being used for surveillance and defense, it fell into his desire to protect society and that is why he wanted to help contribute to the research in this field. Once Luke graduates he plans on working for the FBI doing digital forensics and later getting his master's degree in Computer Science.
