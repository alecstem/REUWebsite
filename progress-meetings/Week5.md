# Week 5

## End Goal

* Create an algorithm that reads in two GPS points and creates the most efficient 3D path for a UAV to traverse the points given with regard to the time, distance, and energy usage from aerially obtained LiDAR scans and the ablity to change course mid-flight if the best path is obstructed.

## Progress Report
* Updated 3D obstacle matrix if obstacle is detected before recalculating best path.
* Finished introduction for midterm paper.
* Finished problem statement and motivation for midterm paper.
* Currently working on Literary Analysis.
* Finished presentation slides for this week.
* Created website for midterm.

## Future Objectives
* Work more on collision avoidance.
* Fix the path smoothing issues.
* Improve speed of program.
* Get access to the rest of the LiDAR data automatically.
* Finish the midterm assignments.
* Start testing in real life.
