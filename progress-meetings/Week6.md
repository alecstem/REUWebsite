# Week 6

## End Goal

* Create an algorithm that reads in two GPS points and creates the most efficient 3D path for a UAV to traverse the points given concerning the time, distance, and energy usage from aerially obtained LiDAR scans and the ability to change course mid-flight if the best path is obstructed.

## Progress Report
* Finished midterm paper.
* Finished project website (hosted on GitHub pages)
* Finished midterm presentation slides.
* Added in an optimized trajectory component to collision avoidance by factoring in distance to end node.
* Created demos for collision avoidance and our process.
* Got an almost complete process created from start to finish.

## Obstacles
* Loading in the correct .las files.
* Debugging collision avoidance algorithm.
* Debugging complete process test.

## Future Objectives
* Work more on collision avoidance.
* Fix the path smoothing issues.
* Improve the speed of the program.
* Get access to the rest of the LiDAR data automatically.
* Finish the midterm assignments.
* Start testing in real life.

## Weekly Evaluation
* This was another solid week of progress. We were able to complete our midterm deliverables with confidence and we were able to generate working demos of our process. We plan to start real-life testing now that we have a confident and reliable system in place this coming week. Overall we are encouraged by the way our research has developed and hope to generate publishable results in our simulations and real-life testing.
