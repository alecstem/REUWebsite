## Results
This is where you can view the table stastictics we found through our various test. The computer and internet specifications are The computer specifications are an HP laptop with processor: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz 2.70 GHz, ram: 32.0 GB (31.7 GB usable), system type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor, graphics card: Intel iRISxe. The internet being used measured by ”Measurement LAB” had a download speed of 178.1 Mbps and an upload speed of 250.1 Mbps. Each test was also ran with a buffer size of 3m and our adapted A* algorithem.
